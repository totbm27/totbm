# Method Intention
The overall intention of the fromReader method is to read characters from a Reader object with a specified buffer size, append them to a StringBuilder, and return the resulting string.

# Method Intention
The fromReader method is intended to read characters from a Reader object in chunks of a specified buffer size, append them to a StringBuilder, and finally return the concatenated string representation of the characters read.

# Method Intention
The fromReader method is designed to read characters from a Reader object with a specified buffer size, appending the read characters to a StringBuilder until the end of the input stream is reached, and then returning the accumulated characters as a single String.
