# Method Intention
The escape method is designed to process a given character sequence by scanning each character and writing it to the provided Writer while replacing certain characters—based on whether HTML-safe escaping is enabled in the ZapposJson configuration—with their corresponding escape sequences to ensure the output is safely encoded for JSON or HTML contexts.
