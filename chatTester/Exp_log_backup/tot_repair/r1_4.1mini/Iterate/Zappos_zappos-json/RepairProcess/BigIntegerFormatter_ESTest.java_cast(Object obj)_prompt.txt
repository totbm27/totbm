# Focal Method
@Override
public BigInteger cast(Object obj) {
    return BigInteger.class.cast(obj);
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method is intended to safely convert or cast the given object to a BigInteger type by leveraging Java's Class.cast() method, ensuring a ClassCastException is thrown if the object is not an instance of BigInteger.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
