}

# Method Intention
The getExtractionMethod() method is intended to provide the extraction method used for the Table object, allowing external users to retrieve and potentially utilize this information for further processing or analysis.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
