# Focal Method
public float getArea() {
    return this.width * this.height;
}

# Method Intention
The getArea() method in the Rectangle class is intended to calculate and return the area of the rectangle by multiplying its width and height properties.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
