# Focal Method
@Override
public Date cast(Object obj) {
    return Date.class.cast(obj);
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method is intended to safely convert or cast the given generic Object parameter into a java.util.Date instance by leveraging the built-in Class.cast() method, ensuring a runtime type check and throwing a ClassCastException if the object is not of type Date.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```

# JavaDateFormatter class

# Test Method
    @Test

# Instruction
The test method has a bug error (marked <Buggy Line>). 
Please fix the buggy line based on the given "JavaDateFormatter" class information (it is crucial) and return the complete and compilable test method after fix.
