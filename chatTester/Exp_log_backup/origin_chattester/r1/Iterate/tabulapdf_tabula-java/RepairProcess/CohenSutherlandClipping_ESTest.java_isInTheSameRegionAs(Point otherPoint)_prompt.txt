# Method Intention
The isInTheSameRegionAs(Point otherPoint) method is intended to compare the region of the current Point object with the region of another Point object to determine if they belong to the same region.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
