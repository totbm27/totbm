# Method Intention


# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.

# Test Method
@Test

# Instruction
The test method has a bug error (marked <Buggy Line>). 
 Please repair the buggy code line and return the complete and compilable test method after repair, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6. 
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.

# Method Intention
The checkValidLatLong method is intended to validate whether a given string represents a valid latitude or longitude value by checking if it is not empty and conforms to the format of a latitude or longitude, and if not, throw an error message.
