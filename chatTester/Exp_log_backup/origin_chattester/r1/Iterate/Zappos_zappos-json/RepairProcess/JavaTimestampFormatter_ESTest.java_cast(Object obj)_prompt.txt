# Focal Method
@Override
public Timestamp cast(Object obj) {
    return Timestamp.class.cast(obj);
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method in the JavaTimestampFormatter class is intended to explicitly cast an input object to a Timestamp object, ensuring that the input object is of the correct type for further processing or manipulation.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testCast() {
        JavaTimestampFormatter formatter = new JavaTimestampFormatter();
        Object validObject = new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
        Timestamp result1 = formatter.cast(validObject);
        assertEquals(validObject, result1);

            <Buggy Line>: non-static method cast(java.lang.Object) cannot be referenced from a static context
        Object invalidObject = "Invalid Object";

        try {
            Timestamp result2 = formatter.cast(invalidObject);
            fail("Expected ClassCastException was not thrown");
        } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        }
    }


# Instruction
The test method has a bug error (marked <Buggy Line>). 
 Please repair the buggy code line and return the complete and compilable test method after repair. 
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
