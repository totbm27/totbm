# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
@Override
public String getText(boolean useLineReturns) {
    return getText();
}

# Method Intention
The getText(boolean useLineReturns) method in the TextChunk class is intended to return the text content of the TextChunk object, with an option to include line breaks based on the boolean parameter useLineReturns.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testGetTextWithLineReturns() {
          [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problems: 
 The constructor TextElement(int, int, int, int, String) is undefined
 The constructor TextElement(int, int, int, int, String) is undefined
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
