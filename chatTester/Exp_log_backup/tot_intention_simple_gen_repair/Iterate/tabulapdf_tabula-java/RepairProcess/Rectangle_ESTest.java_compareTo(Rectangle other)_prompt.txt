# Focal Method
public class Rectangle {
public Rectangle() {
    super();
}public Rectangle(float top, float left, float width, float height) {
    super();
    this.setRect(left, top, width, height);
}
# Focal method
public void setBottom(float bottom) {
    this.setRect(this.x, this.y, this.width, bottom - this.y);
}
}

# Method Intention
The setBottom(float bottom) method in the Rectangle class is intended to update the height of the rectangle by adjusting the bottom coordinate while keeping the top coordinate constant.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
