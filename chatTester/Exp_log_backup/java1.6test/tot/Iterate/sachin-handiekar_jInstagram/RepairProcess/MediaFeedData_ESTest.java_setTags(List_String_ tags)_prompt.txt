# Test Method
@Test
public void testSetTags() {
    MediaFeedData mediaFeedData = new MediaFeedData();

       <Buggy Line>: cannot find symbol method "of(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)" in List
    List<String> tags = List.of("tag1", "tag2", "tag3");

# Instruction
The test method has a bug error (marked <Buggy Line>). 
Please fix the buggy line based on the given "List" class information (it is crucial) and return the complete and compilable test method after fix. 
Note that the contents in  "List" class  cannot be modified, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6.
