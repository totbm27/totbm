# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public void deregister(Class<?> clazz) {
    writerCodeGenerator.deregister(clazz);
    readerCodeGenerator.deregister(clazz);
}

# Method Intention
The deregister(Class<?> clazz) method is intended to remove or unregister the specified class type from both the JSON writer and reader code generators, effectively disabling any custom serialization and deserialization behavior associated with that class within the ZapposJson framework.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testDeregister() {
        ZapposJson zapposJson = ZapposJson.getInstance();
      [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " com.zappos.json.JsonException org.evosuite.runtime.mock.java.lang.MockThrowable: [source error] ; is missing " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.

# Method Intention
The deregister(Class<?> clazz) method is intended to remove or unregister the specified class type from both the JSON writer and reader code generators, effectively preventing that class from being processed or handled during JSON serialization and deserialization operations.
