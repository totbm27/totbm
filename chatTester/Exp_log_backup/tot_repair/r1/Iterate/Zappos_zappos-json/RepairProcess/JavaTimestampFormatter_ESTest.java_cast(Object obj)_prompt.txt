# Focal Method
@Override
public Timestamp cast(Object obj) {
    return Timestamp.class.cast(obj);
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method in the JavaTimestampFormatter class is intended to explicitly cast the input object to a Timestamp object, assuming that the input object is indeed an instance of Timestamp or a subclass of Timestamp.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```

# JavaTimestampFormatter class
package com.zappos.json.format;
public class JavaTimestampFormatter {
public Timestamp cast(Object obj);
public String format(ZapposJson zapposJson, Timestamp object);

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testCast() {
        JavaTimestampFormatter formatter = new JavaTimestampFormatter();
        Object validObject = new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
        Timestamp result1 = formatter.cast(validObject);

            <Buggy Line>: cannot find symbol method "cast(java.lang.Object)" in JavaTimestampFormatter_ESTest
        Object invalidObject = "Invalid Object";

        try {

# Instruction
The test method has a bug error (marked <Buggy Line>). 
Please fix the buggy line based on the given "JavaTimestampFormatter" class information (it is crucial) and return the complete and compilable test method after fix. 
Note that the contents in  "JavaTimestampFormatter" class  cannot be modified.
