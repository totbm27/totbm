# Method Intention
The getAttributeType() method is designed to provide external access to the private attrType field by returning the Class object that represents the data type of the attribute encapsulated within the AttributeInfo instance.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
