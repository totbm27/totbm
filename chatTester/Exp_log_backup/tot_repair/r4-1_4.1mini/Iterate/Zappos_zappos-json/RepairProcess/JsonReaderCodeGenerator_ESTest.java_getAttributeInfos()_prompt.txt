# Method Intention
The getAttributeInfos() method is intended to provide external access to the internal list of AttributeInfo objects associated with the TypeInfo instance, allowing callers to retrieve all attribute metadata currently stored within that type representation.

Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
