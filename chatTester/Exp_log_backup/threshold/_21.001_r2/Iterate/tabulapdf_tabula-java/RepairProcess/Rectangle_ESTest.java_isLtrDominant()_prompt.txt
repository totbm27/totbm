# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public int isLtrDominant() {
    return 0;
}

# Method Intention
Based on the context provided, the isLtrDominant() method in the Rectangle class appears to be intended to determine whether the rectangle is left-to-right dominant in terms of its orientation or layout.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testIsLtrDominant() {
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(0, 0, 10, 5);
       [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.AssertionError " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
