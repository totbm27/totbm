# Focal Method
@Override
public ValueFormatter<T> setPattern(String pattern) {
    this.pattern = pattern;
    return this;
}

# Method Intention
The setPattern(String pattern) method is intended to assign a formatting pattern to the current ValueFormatter instance by storing the provided pattern string internally and returning the instance itself to allow method chaining.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
