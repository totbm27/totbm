# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public int isLtrDominant() {
    return 0;
}

# Method Intention
The isLtrDominant() method in the Rectangle class appears to be intended to determine whether the rectangle is left-to-right dominant, possibly based on the relative positions of its top-left and bottom-right corners.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testIsLtrDominant_WidthGreaterThanHeight_Returns1() {
    float top = 0;
    float left = 0;
    float width = 10; 
    float height = 5;
    Rectangle testRectangle = new Rectangle(top, left, width, height);
    int result = testRectangle.isLtrDominant();
   [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.AssertionError " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
