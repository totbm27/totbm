# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public void addPayload(String payload) {
    this.payload = payload;
}

# Method Intention
The addPayload(String payload) method is intended to assign or update the content of the request's payload by storing the provided string data into the object's payload field, thereby setting the body content that will be sent with the request.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testAddPayload() {
        Verbs verb = Verbs.GET;
        String url = "http://example.com";
        Request request = new Request(verb, url);
        String payload = "{\"key\": \"value\"}";
        request.addPayload(payload);
        try {
            java.lang.reflect.Field payloadField = Request.class.getDeclaredField("payload");
            payloadField.setAccessible(true);
            String actualPayload = (String) payloadField.get(request);
                [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure {"key": "value"} expected:<[{"key": "value"}]> but was:<[Payload should be set correctly]> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
