# Method Intention


# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.

# Instruction
The test method has a bug error (marked <Buggy Line>). 
 Please repair the buggy code line and return the complete and compilable test method after repair, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6.

# Method Intention
The checkValidRadius method is intended to validate that the input radiusString is a non-empty string containing a numeric value, and if not, throw an error message specified by the errorMsg parameter.
