# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public static List<Ruling> cropRulingsToArea(List<Ruling> rulings, Rectangle2D area) {
    ArrayList<Ruling> rv = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Ruling r : rulings) {

# Method Intention
The cropRulingsToArea method is intended to filter a list of Ruling objects based on whether they intersect with a specified Rectangle2D area, returning a new list containing only the Ruling objects that overlap with the given area.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testCropRulingsToArea() {
        Rectangle2D area = new Rectangle2D.Float(0, 0, 10, 10);
        List<Ruling> rulings = new ArrayList<>();
        Ruling ruling1 = new Ruling(0, 0, 5, 5);
        Ruling ruling2 = new Ruling(3, 3, 7, 7);
        Ruling ruling3 = new Ruling(12, 12, 3, 3);
        rulings.add(ruling1);
        rulings.add(ruling2);
        rulings.add(ruling3);
        List<Ruling> croppedRulings = Ruling.cropRulingsToArea(rulings, area);
