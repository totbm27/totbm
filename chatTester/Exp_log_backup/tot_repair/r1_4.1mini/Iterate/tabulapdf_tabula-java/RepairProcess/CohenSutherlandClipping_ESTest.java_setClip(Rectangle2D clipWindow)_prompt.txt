# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public void setClip(Rectangle2D clipWindow) {
    xMin = clipWindow.getX();
    xMax = xMin + clipWindow.getWidth();
    yMin = clipWindow.getY();
    yMax = yMin + clipWindow.getHeight();
}

# Method Intention
The setClip(Rectangle2D clipWindow) method initializes or updates the clipping boundary coordinates by extracting the minimum and maximum x and y values from the given rectangular clipping window, thereby defining the rectangular region used for subsequent clipping operations.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testSetClip() {
        Rectangle2D clipWindow = new Rectangle2D.Double(10, 20, 30, 40);
        CohenSutherlandClipping clipping = new CohenSutherlandClipping();
        clipping.setClip(clipWindow);

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problems: 
 The method getXMin() is undefined for the type CohenSutherlandClipping

Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
