# Focal method
public Token getRequestToken() {

# Method Intention
The getRequestToken() method in the InstagramService class is intended to inform users that obtaining a request token is not supported directly, and they should instead use the 'getAuthorizationUrl' method to redirect users for authorization.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
