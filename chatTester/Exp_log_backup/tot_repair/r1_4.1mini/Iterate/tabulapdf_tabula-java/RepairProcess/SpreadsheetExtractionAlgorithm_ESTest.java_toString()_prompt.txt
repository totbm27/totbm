# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
@Override
public String toString() {
    return String.format("%s[point=%s,direction=%s]", this.getClass().getName(), this.point.toString(), this.direction.toString());
}

# Method Intention
The toString() method is intended to provide a clear, formatted string representation of a PolygonVertex object that includes the class name along with the string representations of its point and direction fields, facilitating easy debugging and logging.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testToString() {
           [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problems: 
 Point2D cannot be resolved to a type
 Point2D cannot be resolved to a type
 Direction cannot be resolved to a type
 Direction cannot be resolved to a variable
 PolygonVertex cannot be resolved to a type

 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
