# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public int isLtrDominant() {
    return 0;
}

# Method Intention
The isLtrDominant() method in the Rectangle class appears to be intended to determine whether the rectangle is left-to-right dominant, possibly based on the relative positioning of its top and left coordinates.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testIsLtrDominant() {
        Rectangle rectangle1 = new Rectangle(0, 0, 5, 3);
       [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.AssertionError " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
