# Focal method
public String getURL() {

# Method Intention
The getURL() method is intended to provide external access to the URL string associated with the HTTP connection from which the Response object was created, allowing callers to retrieve the original request URL as a simple string.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
