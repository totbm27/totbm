# Method Intention
The writeArray method is intended to serialize an array of objects into a JSON array format by iterating through the array elements, converting each object to its JSON representation using the provided ZapposJson instance, and writing the resulting JSON strings to the specified Writer object with appropriate commas and array delimiters.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
