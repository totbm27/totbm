# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
@Override
public String getText() {
    return getText(true);
}

# Method Intention
The getText() method is intended to provide a textual representation of the Cell's content by invoking an overloaded version of getText with a boolean parameter set to true, likely to retrieve the full or default formatted text associated with the Cell.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetText() {
        Cell cell = new Cell(10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f, 40.0f);
        String expectedText = "Sample Text";
      [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problems: 
 The method setText(String) is undefined for the type Cell
 The method setText(String) is undefined for the type Cell
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
