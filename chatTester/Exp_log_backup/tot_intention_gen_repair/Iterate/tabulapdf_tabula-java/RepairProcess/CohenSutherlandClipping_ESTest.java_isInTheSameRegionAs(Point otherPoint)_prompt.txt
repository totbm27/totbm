# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
boolean isInTheSameRegionAs(Point otherPoint) {
    return this.region == otherPoint.region;
}

# Method Intention
The isInTheSameRegionAs(Point otherPoint) method is intended to compare the region of the current Point object with the region of another Point object to determine if they belong to the same region.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testIsInTheSameRegionAs_ReturnsFalse_WhenPointsAreInDifferentRegions() {
          [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problems: 
 Point cannot be resolved to a type
 Point cannot be resolved to a type
 Point cannot be resolved to a type
 Point cannot be resolved to a type
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
