# Method Intention
The cropRulingsToArea method is intended to filter a list of Ruling objects based on whether they intersect with a specified Rectangle2D area, returning a new list containing only the Ruling objects that overlap with the given area.

    List<Ruling> result = Ruling.cropRulingsToArea(rulings, area);
    assertEquals(1, result.size());

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.AssertionError " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
