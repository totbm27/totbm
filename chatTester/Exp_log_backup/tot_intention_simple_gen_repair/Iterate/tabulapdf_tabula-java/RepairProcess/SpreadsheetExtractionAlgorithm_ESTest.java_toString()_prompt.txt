# Method Intention
The overall intention of the toString() method in the PolygonVertex class is to provide a human-readable representation of the object's state by returning a formatted string containing the class name, point coordinates, and direction.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
