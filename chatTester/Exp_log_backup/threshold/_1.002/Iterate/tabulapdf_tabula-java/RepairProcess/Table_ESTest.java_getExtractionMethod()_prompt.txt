# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public String getExtractionMethod() {
    return extractionMethod;
}

# Method Intention
The getExtractionMethod() method is intended to provide access to the extraction method used in the Table class, allowing users to retrieve and potentially utilize information about the specific method employed for data extraction.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetExtractionMethod() {
        String expectedExtractionMethod = "SomeExtractionMethod";
          [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problem: 
 The constructor Table(String) is not visible
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
