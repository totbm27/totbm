# Focal Method
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "stream";
}

# Method Intention
The toString() method is intended to provide a simple, fixed textual representation of the BasicExtractionAlgorithm class by returning the string "stream" whenever the object is converted to a string.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
