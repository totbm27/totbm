# Method Intention
The random(int n, char[] chars) method is intended to generate a random string of length n by selecting characters from the provided char array, allowing for customizable and varied string generation based on the input characters and length.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
