# Focal Method
@Override
public BigInteger cast(Object obj) {
    return BigInteger.class.cast(obj);
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method in the BigIntegerFormatter class is intended to explicitly cast an input object to a BigInteger type, ensuring that the object is of the correct type for further processing or manipulation within the context of the class.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
