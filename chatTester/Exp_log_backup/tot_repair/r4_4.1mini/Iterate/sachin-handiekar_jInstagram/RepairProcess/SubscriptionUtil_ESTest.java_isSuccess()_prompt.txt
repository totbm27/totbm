# Focal Method
public  static class VerificationResult {
private final boolean success;
public VerificationResult(boolean success, String resultingSignature) {
    this.success = success;

# Focal method
public boolean isSuccess() {

}

# Method Intention
The isSuccess() method is designed to provide external access to the VerificationResult object's internal success status by returning a boolean value that indicates whether the verification process it represents was successful or not.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
