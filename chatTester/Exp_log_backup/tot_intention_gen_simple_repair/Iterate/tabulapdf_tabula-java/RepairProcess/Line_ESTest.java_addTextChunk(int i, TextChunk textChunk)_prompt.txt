# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public void setTextElements(List<TextChunk> textChunks) {
    this.textChunks = textChunks;
}

# Method Intention
The setTextElements method in the Line class is intended to update the list of TextChunk elements stored in the textChunks field with a new list provided as a parameter.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testAddTextChunk() {
    Line line = new Line();
      [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problems: 
 The constructor TextChunk(String) is undefined
 The constructor TextChunk(String) is undefined
 The constructor TextChunk(String) is undefined
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
