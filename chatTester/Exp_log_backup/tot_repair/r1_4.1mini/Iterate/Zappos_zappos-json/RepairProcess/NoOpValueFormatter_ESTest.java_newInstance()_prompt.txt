# Focal Method
@Override
public ValueFormatter<Object> newInstance() {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("NoOp");
}

# Method Intention
The newInstance() method is intentionally designed to prevent the creation of new instances by always throwing an UnsupportedOperationException with the message "NoOp," signaling that this operation is not supported or applicable for this class.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
