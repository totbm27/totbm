# Focal Method
public class NoOpValueFormatter {
# Focal method
@Override
public Object cast(Object obj) {
    return obj;
}
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method in the NoOpValueFormatter class is intended to simply return the input object as is without any modification or casting, essentially serving as a no-operation (NoOp) method for value formatting.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
