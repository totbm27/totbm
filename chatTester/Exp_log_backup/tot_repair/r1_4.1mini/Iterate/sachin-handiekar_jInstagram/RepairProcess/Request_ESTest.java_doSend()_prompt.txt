# Method Intention
The setConnection(HttpURLConnection connection) method is intended to assign or update the internal HttpURLConnection object used by the Request instance, enabling it to manage or configure the underlying HTTP connection for subsequent network operations.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
