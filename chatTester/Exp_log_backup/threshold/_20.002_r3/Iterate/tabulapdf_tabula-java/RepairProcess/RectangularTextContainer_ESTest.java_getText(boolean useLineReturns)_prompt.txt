# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
@Override
public String getText(boolean useLineReturns) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

# Method Intention
The getText(boolean useLineReturns) method is intended to retrieve the text content of the RectangularTextContainer object, with an option to include line breaks based on the value of the useLineReturns parameter.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetTextWithLineReturns() {
        RectangularTextContainer container = new RectangularTextContainer(10.0f, 20.0f, 50.0f, 30.0f);
       [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problem: 
 Arrays cannot be resolved
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
