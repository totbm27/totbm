# Focal Method
@Override
public Instant cast(Object obj) {
    return Instant.class.cast(obj);
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method is intended to safely convert or cast a given generic Object to an Instant type by leveraging Java's built-in class casting mechanism, ensuring that the input is treated specifically as an Instant instance or throwing a ClassCastException if it is not.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
