# Focal Method
public class Counts {
@SerializedName("follows")
private int follows;
# Focal method
public void setFollows(int follows) {
    this.follows = follows;

}

# Method Intention
The setFollows(int follows) method is designed to update the private field 'follows' of the Counts class by assigning it a new integer value provided as an argument, thereby modifying the number of follows associated with an instance of the class.
