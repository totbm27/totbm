# Focal Method
public List<JsonBeanAttribute> getAccessors(Class<?> clazz) {
    return getAccessorsOrMutators(clazz, true);
}

# Method Intention
The getAccessors(Class<?> clazz) method is intended to retrieve and return a list of all accessor methods (i.e., getter methods) associated with the specified class by internally delegating to a helper method that distinguishes accessors from mutators.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
