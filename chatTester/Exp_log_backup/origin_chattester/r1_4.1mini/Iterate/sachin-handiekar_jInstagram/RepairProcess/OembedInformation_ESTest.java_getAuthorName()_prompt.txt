# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public void setAuthorName(String authorName) {
    this.authorName = authorName;
}

# Method Intention
The setAuthorName(String authorName) method is designed to assign or update the value of the private field authorName, which represents the name of the author in the OembedInformation class, thereby allowing external code to modify this specific piece of metadata associated with an embedded resource.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testSetAuthorName() {
    OembedInformation info = new OembedInformation();
    String testName = "John Doe";
    info.setAuthorName(testName);
    try {
        java.lang.reflect.Field field = OembedInformation.class.getDeclaredField("authorName");
        field.setAccessible(true);
        String actualName = (String) field.get(info);
              [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure John Doe expected:<[John Doe]> but was:<[The authorName field should be set correctly.]> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
