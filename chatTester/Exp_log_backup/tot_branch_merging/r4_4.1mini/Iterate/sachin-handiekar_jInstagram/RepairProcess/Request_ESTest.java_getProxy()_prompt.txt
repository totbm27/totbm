# Focal Method
public class Request {

# Method Intention
The setProxy(Proxy proxy) method is intended to assign a specific Proxy object to the Request instance, thereby configuring the request to route its network communication through the given proxy server.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
