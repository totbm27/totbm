# Focal Method
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "stream";
}

# Method Intention
The toString() method is intended to provide a simple, fixed textual representation of the BasicExtractionAlgorithm class by returning the string "stream" whenever the object is converted to a string.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```

# Method Intention
The toString() method is intended to provide a simple, fixed textual representation of the BasicExtractionAlgorithm class by returning the string "stream" whenever the object is converted to a string.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testToStringReturnsStream() {
    BasicExtractionAlgorithm algorithm = new BasicExtractionAlgorithm();
    String result = algorithm.toString();
       [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure stream expected:<[stream]> but was:<[toString() should return 'stream']> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
