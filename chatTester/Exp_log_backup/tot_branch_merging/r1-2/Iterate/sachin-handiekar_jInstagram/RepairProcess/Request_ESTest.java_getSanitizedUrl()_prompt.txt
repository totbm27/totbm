# Method Intention
The overall intention of the getSanitizedUrl() method is to return a sanitized version of the URL by removing any query string parameters and replacing any port numbers specified in the URL with an empty string.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testGetSanitizedUrl_removesQueryParametersAndPortNumbers() {
    Request request = new Request(Verbs.GET, "https://example.com:8080/api/something?param1=value1&param2=value2");

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure expected:<https://example.com[]/api/something> but was:<https://example.com[:8080]/api/something> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
