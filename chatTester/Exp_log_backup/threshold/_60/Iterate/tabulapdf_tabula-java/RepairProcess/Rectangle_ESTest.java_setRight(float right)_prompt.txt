# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public void setRight(float right) {
    this.setRect(this.x, this.y, right - this.x, this.height);
}

# Method Intention
The setRight(float right) method in the Rectangle class is intended to update the right coordinate of the rectangle by adjusting its width based on the new right coordinate provided, while keeping the top and left coordinates unchanged.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testSetRight() {
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(0, 0, 5, 10);
        rectangle.setRight(10);
        assertEquals(10, rectangle.getRight(), 0.001);
        assertEquals(0, rectangle.getLeft(), 0.001);
        [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.AssertionError " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
