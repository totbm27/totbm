# Focal Method
static class AttributeInfo {
private Class<?> collectionType;
public AttributeInfo(Class<?> attrType, JsonBeanAttribute detail) {
    this.attrType = attrType;

}
# Focal method
public AttributeInfo setCollectionType(Class<?> collectionType) {

}

# Method Intention
The setCollectionType(Class<?> collectionType) method is designed to assign a specific collection class type to the AttributeInfo instance's collectionType field and then return the same instance to allow for method chaining or fluent-style configuration.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
