# Focal Method
public static PageDims of(final float top, final float left, final float width, final float height) {
    return new PageDims(top, left, width, height);
}

# Method Intention
The of(final float top, final float left, final float width, final float height) method is a static factory method designed to create and return a new immutable PageDims instance initialized with the specified top, left, width, and height values, providing a clear and concise way to instantiate the class without exposing its constructor.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testOf() {
        float top = 10.0f;
        float left = 20.0f;
        float width = 100.0f;
        float height = 50.0f;
        PageDims pageDims = PageDims.of(top, left, width, height);

        assertEquals(left, pageDims.getLeft(), 0.0f);
        assertEquals(width, pageDims.getWidth(), 0.0f);

        <Buggy Line>: no suitable method found for assertEquals(float,float,java.lang.String)
        assertEquals(height, pageDims.getHeight(), 0.0f);

    }


# Instruction
The test method has a bug error (marked <Buggy Line>). 
Please fix the buggy line based on the given "Assert" class information (it is crucial) and return the complete and compilable test method after fix. 
Note that the contents in  "Assert" class  cannot be modified.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
