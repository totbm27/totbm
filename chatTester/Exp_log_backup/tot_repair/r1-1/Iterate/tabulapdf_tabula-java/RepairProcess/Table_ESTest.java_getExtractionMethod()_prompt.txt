# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public String getExtractionMethod() {
    return extractionMethod;
}

# Method Intention
The getExtractionMethod() method is intended to provide a way for external classes to access and retrieve the extraction method used in the Table class, allowing for transparency and visibility into the underlying extraction process.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetExtractionMethod() {
        String expectedExtractionMethod = "SomeExtractionMethod";
          [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problem: 
 The constructor Table(String) is not visible
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
