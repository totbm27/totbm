# Focal Method
public class InstagramService {
public InstagramService(InstagramApi api, OAuthConfig config) {
    this.api = api;

}
# Focal method
public Token getRequestToken() {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Unsupported operation, please use 'getAuthorizationUrl' and redirect your users there");

}

# Method Intention
The getRequestToken() method in the InstagramService class is intended to inform users that they should not directly call this method, but instead use the 'getAuthorizationUrl' method to redirect users for obtaining a request token.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
