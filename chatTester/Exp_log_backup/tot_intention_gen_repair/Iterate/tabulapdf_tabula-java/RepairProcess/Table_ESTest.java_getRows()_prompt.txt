# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public String getExtractionMethod() {
    return extractionMethod;
}

# Method Intention
The getExtractionMethod() method is intended to provide access to the extraction method used in the Table class, allowing external classes to retrieve and potentially utilize this information for further processing or analysis.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testGetRowsComputesAndMemoizesCorrectly() {
      [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
