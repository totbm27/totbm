The setConnection(HttpURLConnection connection) method is intended to assign the provided HttpURLConnection object to the connection field within the Request class, allowing for the establishment of a connection for subsequent HTTP requests.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
