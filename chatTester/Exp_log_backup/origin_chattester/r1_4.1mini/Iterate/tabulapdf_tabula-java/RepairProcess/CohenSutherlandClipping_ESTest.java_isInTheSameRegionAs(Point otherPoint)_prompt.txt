}
# Focal method
boolean isInTheSameRegionAs(Point otherPoint) {

}

# Method Intention
The isInTheSameRegionAs(Point otherPoint) method determines whether the current Point instance and another given Point instance belong to the same predefined spatial region by comparing their region identifiers.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
