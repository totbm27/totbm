# Method Intention
The merge method in the RectangularTextContainer class is intended to combine the text elements of two RectangularTextContainer instances, with the order of insertion determined by the comparison of the two instances, and then update the current instance with the merged text elements.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
