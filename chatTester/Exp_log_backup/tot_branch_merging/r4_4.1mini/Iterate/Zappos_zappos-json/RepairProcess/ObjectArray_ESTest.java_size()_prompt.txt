# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public int size() {
    return size;

# Method Intention
The size() method is intended to provide external access to the current number of elements stored in the ObjectArray by returning the value of its private size field.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testSize() {
    ObjectArray array = new ObjectArray();
    assertEquals(0, array.size());
  [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.NullPointerException None " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
