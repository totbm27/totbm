# Focal Method
public static PageDims of(final float top, final float left, final float width, final float height) {
    return new PageDims(top, left, width, height);
}

# Method Intention
The of(final float top, final float left, final float width, final float height) method in the PageDims class is intended to provide a static factory method for creating instances of PageDims with specified top, left, width, and height values, encapsulating the construction logic within the class itself.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetTop() {
        float expectedTop = 10.0f;
        PageDims pageDims = PageDims.of(expectedTop, 5.0f, 20.0f, 15.0f);
        float actualTop = pageDims.getTop();
        assertEquals(expectedTop, actualTop, 0.0f);
    }


# Instruction
The test method has a bug error (marked <Buggy Line>). 
Please fix the buggy line based on the given "Assert" class information (it is crucial) and return the complete and compilable test method after fix. 
Note that the contents in  "Assert" class  cannot be modified, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
