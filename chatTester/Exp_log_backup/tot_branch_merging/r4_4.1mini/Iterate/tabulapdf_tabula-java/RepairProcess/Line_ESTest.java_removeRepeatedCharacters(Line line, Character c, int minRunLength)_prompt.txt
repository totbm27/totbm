# Focal Method

# Method Intention
The removeRepeatedCharacters method processes a given Line object by iterating through its constituent TextChunks, removing sequences where the specified character c repeats consecutively at least minRunLength times within each TextChunk (via the squeeze method), and returns a new Line composed of these modified TextChunks without such repeated character runs.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.

# Method Intention
The removeRepeatedCharacters method processes a given Line object by iterating through its constituent TextChunks and, for each, removing or condensing sequences where the specified character c repeats consecutively at least minRunLength times, ultimately returning a new Line composed of these modified TextChunks without such repeated character runs.
