# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
@Override
public String toString() {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    String s = super.toString();
    sb.append(s.substring(0, s.length() - 1));
    sb.append(String.format(",text=%s]", this.getText() == null ? "null" : "\"" + this.getText() + "\""));
    return sb.toString();
}

# Method Intention
The toString() method aims to extend the string representation of the superclass by appending a formatted segment that includes the current object's text content—enclosed in quotes if non-null or represented as "null" otherwise—just before the closing bracket, thereby providing a more informative and descriptive output of the RectangularTextContainer instance.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testToString() {
        RectangularTextContainer rectangularTextContainer = new RectangularTextContainer(10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f, 40.0f);
       [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problem: 
 The method setText(String) is undefined for the type RectangularTextContainer
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
