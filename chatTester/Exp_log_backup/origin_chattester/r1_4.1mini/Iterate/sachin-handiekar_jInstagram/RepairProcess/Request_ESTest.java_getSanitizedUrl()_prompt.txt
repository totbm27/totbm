# Method Intention
The getSanitizedUrl() method aims to return a cleaned version of the stored URL by removing any query string parameters (everything following a '?') and stripping out any port number specified as a colon followed by exactly four digits.

# Test Method
    @Test

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure expected:<http://example.com[]/path> but was:<http://example.com[:8080]/path> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
