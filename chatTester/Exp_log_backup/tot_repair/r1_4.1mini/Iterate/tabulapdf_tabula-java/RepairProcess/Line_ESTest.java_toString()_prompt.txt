# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
@Override
public String toString() {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    String s = super.toString();
    sb.append(s, 0, s.length() - 1);
    sb.append(",chunks=");
    for (TextChunk te : this.textChunks) {
        sb.append("'" + te.getText() + "', ");
    }
    sb.append(']');
    return sb.toString();
}

# Method Intention
The toString() method aims to create a string representation of the Line object by extending the default superclass string (excluding its closing bracket) with a detailed listing of the text content from each TextChunk in the textChunks list, formatted as a comma-separated sequence of quoted text segments enclosed within square brackets.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testToString() {
        Line line = new Line();
          [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problems: 
 The constructor TextChunk(String) is undefined
 The constructor TextChunk(String) is undefined
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
