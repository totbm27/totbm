# Focal Method
class Point {
int region;
Point(double x, double y) {
    setPositionAndRegion(x, y);
}
# Focal method
boolean isInTheSameRegionAs(Point otherPoint) {
    return this.region == otherPoint.region;

}

# Method Intention
The isInTheSameRegionAs(Point otherPoint) method determines whether the current Point instance and another given Point instance belong to the same predefined spatial region by comparing their region identifiers.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
