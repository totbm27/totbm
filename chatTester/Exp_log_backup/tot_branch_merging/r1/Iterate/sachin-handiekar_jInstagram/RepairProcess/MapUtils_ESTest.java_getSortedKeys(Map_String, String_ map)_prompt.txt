# Method Intention
The getSortedKeys method is intended to take a Map of String keys and values, extract and sort the keys in ascending order, and return them as a List of Strings.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
