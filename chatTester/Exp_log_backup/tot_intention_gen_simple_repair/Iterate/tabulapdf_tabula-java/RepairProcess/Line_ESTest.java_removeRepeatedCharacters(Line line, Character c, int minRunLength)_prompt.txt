# Method Intention
The removeRepeatedCharacters method aims to take a Line object, identify and remove consecutive occurrences of a specified Character within TextChunks that meet a minimum run length, and return a new Line object with the modified TextChunks.

# Test Method
@Test

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problems:

 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
