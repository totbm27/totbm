# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public String getSanitizedUrl() {
    return url.replaceAll("\\?.*", "").replace("\\:\\d{4}", "");
}

# Method Intention
The getSanitizedUrl() method aims to return a cleaned version of the stored URL by removing any query string parameters (everything following a '?') and stripping out any port numbers formatted as a colon followed by exactly four digits.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testGetSanitizedUrl() {
    Verbs verb = Verbs.GET; 
    String urlWithQueryAndPort = "http://example.com:8080/path?param=value";
    String urlWithQueryOnly = "http://example.com/path?param=value";
    String urlWithPortOnly = "http://example.com:8080/path";
    String urlWithoutQueryOrPort = "http://example.com/path";
    Request requestWithQueryAndPort = new Request(verb, urlWithQueryAndPort);
    Request requestWithQueryOnly = new Request(verb, urlWithQueryOnly);
    Request requestWithPortOnly = new Request(verb, urlWithPortOnly);

   [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure expected:<http://example.com[]/path> but was:<http://example.com[:8080]/path> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
