# Method Intention
The overall intention of the toString() method in the Rectangle class is to provide a custom string representation of the Rectangle object by appending the bottom and right coordinates to the default string representation obtained from the superclass, ensuring a clear and informative output for debugging and logging purposes.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testToString_CustomStringRepresentation() {
    float top = 2;
    float left = 3;
    float width = 5;
    float height = 4;
    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(top, left, width, height);
    String actual = rectangle.toString();
    String expected = "java.awt.Rectangle[x=3.0,y=2.0,width=5.0,height=4.0,bottom=6.0,right=8.0]";
   [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure expected:<[java.awt.Rectangle[x=3.0,y=2.0,width=5.0,height=4.0,bottom=6.0,right=8.]0]> but was:<[technology.tabula.Rectangle[x=3.0,y=2.0,w=5.0,h=4.0,bottom=6.000000,right=8.00000]0]> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
