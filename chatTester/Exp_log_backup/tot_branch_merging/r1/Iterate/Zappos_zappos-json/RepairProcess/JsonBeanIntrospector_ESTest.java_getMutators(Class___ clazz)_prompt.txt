# Focal Method
public List<JsonBeanAttribute> getMutators(Class<?> clazz) {
    return getAccessorsOrMutators(clazz, false);
}

# Method Intention
The getMutators(Class<?> clazz) method in the JsonBeanIntrospector class is intended to retrieve a list of mutator methods (setters) for a given class, by calling the getAccessorsOrMutators method with the specified class and a flag indicating that mutators should be returned.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
