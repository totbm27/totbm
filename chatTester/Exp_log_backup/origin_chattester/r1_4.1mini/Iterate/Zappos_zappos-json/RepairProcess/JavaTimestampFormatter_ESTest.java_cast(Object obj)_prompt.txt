# Focal Method
@Override
public Timestamp cast(Object obj) {
    return Timestamp.class.cast(obj);
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method is intended to safely convert or cast a given generic Object instance into a java.sql.Timestamp type, throwing a ClassCastException if the object is not compatible.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```

# JavaTimestampFormatter class

# Test Method
    @Test

# Instruction
The test method has a bug error (marked <Buggy Line>). 
Please fix the buggy line based on the given "JavaTimestampFormatter" class information (it is crucial) and return the complete and compilable test method after fix. 
Note that the contents in  "JavaTimestampFormatter" class  cannot be modified.
