# Method Intention
The setTextElements(List<TextChunk> textChunks) method is intended to replace the current collection of TextChunk objects within the Line instance with a new list provided as an argument, effectively updating the line's textual content elements.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
