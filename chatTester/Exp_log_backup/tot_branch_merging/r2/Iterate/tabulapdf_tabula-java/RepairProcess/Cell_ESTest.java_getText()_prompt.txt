# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
@Override
public String getText() {
    return getText(true);
}

# Method Intention
The overall intention of the getText() method in the Cell class is to return the text content of the cell, with an option to include additional formatting or processing based on a boolean parameter.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetText() {
        Cell cell = new Cell(10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f, 40.0f);
        cell.setPlaceholder(false);
        cell.setSpanning(false);
        String text = cell.getText();
         [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure expected:<[Expected text content]> but was:<[]> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
