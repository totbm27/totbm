# Focal Method
@Override
public ValueFormatter<Instant> newInstance() {
    return new JavaTimeInstantFormatter();
}

# Method Intention
The newInstance() method is intended to create and return a new, distinct instance of the JavaTimeInstantFormatter class, ensuring that each call produces a fresh formatter object for formatting Instant values.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
