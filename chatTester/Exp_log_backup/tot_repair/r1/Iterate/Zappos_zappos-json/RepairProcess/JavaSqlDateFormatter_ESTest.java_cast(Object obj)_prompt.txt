# Focal Method
@Override
public Date cast(Object obj) {
    return Date.class.cast(obj);
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method in the JavaSqlDateFormatter class is intended to explicitly cast an input object to a Date class, ensuring that the object is of the correct type for further processing or manipulation within the context of date formatting operations.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
