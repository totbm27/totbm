# Focal Method
@Override
public Date cast(Object obj) {
    return Date.class.cast(obj);
}

# Method Intention
The cast(Object obj) method is intended to safely convert or cast a given generic Object instance to a java.sql.Date type, throwing a ClassCastException if the object is not compatible.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
