# Method Intention
The horizontalOverlap(Rectangle other) method in the Rectangle class is intended to calculate the horizontal overlap between the current rectangle and another specified rectangle by determining the shared area along the x-axis.

# Test Method
@Test

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.AssertionError " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
