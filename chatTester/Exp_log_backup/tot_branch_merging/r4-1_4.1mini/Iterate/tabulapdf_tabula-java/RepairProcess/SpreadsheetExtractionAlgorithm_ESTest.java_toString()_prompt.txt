# Method Intention
The toString() method is intended to provide a clear, formatted string representation of a PolygonVertex object by including its class name along with the string representations of its point and direction fields, facilitating easy debugging and logging.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
