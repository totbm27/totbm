# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public static float[] getFirstDeriv(float[] projection) {
    float[] rv = new float[projection.length];
    rv[0] = projection[1] - projection[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < projection.length - 1; i++) {
        rv[i] = projection[i + 1] - projection[i - 1];

}

# Method Intention
The getFirstDeriv(float[] projection) method computes and returns an array representing the discrete first derivative of the input float array by calculating the difference between adjacent elements, using forward difference at the start, central differences in the middle, and backward difference at the end to approximate the rate of change across the projection data.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetFirstDeriv() {
        float[] inputProjection = {1.0f, 2.0f, 4.0f, 7.0f, 11.0f};
        float[] expectedOutput = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f};
        float[] actualOutput = ProjectionProfile.getFirstDeriv(inputProjection);
        [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.internal.ArrayComparisonFailure arrays first differed at element [1]; expected:<2.0> but was:<3.0> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
