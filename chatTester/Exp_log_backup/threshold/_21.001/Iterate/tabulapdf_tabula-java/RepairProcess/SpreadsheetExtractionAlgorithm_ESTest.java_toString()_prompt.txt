# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
@Override
public String toString() {
    return String.format("%s[point=%s,direction=%s]", this.getClass().getName(), this.point.toString(), this.direction.toString());
}

# Method Intention
The overall intention of the toString() method in the PolygonVertex class is to provide a human-readable representation of the object's state by returning a formatted string containing the class name, point coordinates, and direction.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testToString() {
           [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problems: 
 Point2D cannot be resolved to a type
 Point2D cannot be resolved to a type
 Direction cannot be resolved to a type
 Direction cannot be resolved to a variable
 PolygonVertex cannot be resolved to a type

 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method, and the generated code should be compatible with Java compiler version 1.6.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
