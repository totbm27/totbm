# Focal Method
public List<JsonBeanAttribute> getMutators(Class<?> clazz) {
    return getAccessorsOrMutators(clazz, false);
}

# Method Intention
The getMutators(Class<?> clazz) method is intended to retrieve and return a list of all mutator methods (such as setters) associated with the specified class, by internally invoking a helper method that distinguishes mutators from accessors based on the provided boolean flag.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention`. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```
