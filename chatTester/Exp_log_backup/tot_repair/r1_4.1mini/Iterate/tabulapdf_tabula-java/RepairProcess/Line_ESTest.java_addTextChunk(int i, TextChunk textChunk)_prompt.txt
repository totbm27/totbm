# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public void setTextElements(List<TextChunk> textChunks) {
    this.textChunks = textChunks;
}

# Method Intention
The setTextElements(List<TextChunk> textChunks) method is intended to replace the current collection of TextChunk objects within the Line instance with a new list provided as an argument, effectively updating the line's textual content elements.

# Test Method
@Test
    public void setUp() {
         [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problem: 
 line cannot be resolved to a variable
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
