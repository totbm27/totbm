# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public String getUrl() {
    return url;
}

# Method Intention
The getUrl() method is designed to provide external access to the private url field by returning the current URL string associated with the Request object, enabling other parts of the program to retrieve the target endpoint of the HTTP request encapsulated by this instance.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetUrl() {
        String expectedUrl = "http://example.com/api";
        Request request = new Request(Verbs.GET, expectedUrl);
                  [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure http://example.com/api expected:<[http://example.com/api]> but was:<[The getUrl method should return the URL passed in the constructor]> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
