# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public static ZapposJson getInstance() {
    return ZapposJsonSingleton.INSTANCE.get();

# Method Intention
The getInstance() method in the ZapposJson class is intended to provide a singleton instance of the ZapposJson class, ensuring that only one instance is created and allowing access to its functionality throughout the application.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testRegister() {
        ZapposJson zapposJson = new ZapposJson();
        Class<?> clazz = Date.class;
        try {

            assertNotNull(zapposJson.getValueFormatter(clazz));
            assertNotNull(zapposJson.getValueFormatter(clazz));
        } catch (Exception e) {
                     [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.AssertionError " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
