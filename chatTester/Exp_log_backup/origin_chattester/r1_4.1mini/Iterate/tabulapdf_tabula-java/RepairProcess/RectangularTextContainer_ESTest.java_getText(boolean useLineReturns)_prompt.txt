# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
@Override
public String getText(boolean useLineReturns) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

# Method Intention
The getText(boolean useLineReturns) method is intended to retrieve the textual content contained within the rectangular area, optionally preserving line breaks based on the useLineReturns parameter, but in this implementation it is deliberately unsupported and thus throws an exception.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetTextWithLineReturns() {
        RectangularTextContainer container = new RectangularTextContainer(10.0f, 20.0f, 50.0f, 30.0f);
       [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problem: 
 Arrays cannot be resolved
 " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
