# Focal Method
public class Request {
private Map<String, String> headers;
public Request(Verbs verb, String url) {
    this.verb = verb;
    this.url = url;
    this.querystringParams = new HashMap<String, String>();
    this.bodyParams = new HashMap<String, String>();
    this.headers = new HashMap<String, String>();
}
# Focal method
public void addHeader(String key, String value) {
    this.headers.put(key, value);
}
}

# Method Intention
The addHeader(String key, String value) method is intended to allow the user to add a key-value pair to the headers map of the Request object, enabling customization and inclusion of additional information in the HTTP headers of the request being constructed.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
