public class Preconditions {
# Focal method
public static void checkNotNull(Object object, String errorMsg) {

# Method Intention
The checkNotNull(Object object, String errorMsg) method is designed to verify that the provided object reference is not null, and if it is null, to trigger an error or exception with the specified error message, thereby enforcing a non-null precondition for method arguments or variables.
