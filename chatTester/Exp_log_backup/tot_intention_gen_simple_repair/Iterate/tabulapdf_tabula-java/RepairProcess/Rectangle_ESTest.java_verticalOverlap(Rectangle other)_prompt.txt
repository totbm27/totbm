# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public float verticalOverlap(Rectangle other) {
    return Math.max(0, Math.min(this.getBottom(), other.getBottom()) - Math.max(this.getTop(), other.getTop()));

# Method Intention
The verticalOverlap(Rectangle other) method in the Rectangle class is intended to calculate the vertical overlap between the current rectangle and another specified rectangle by determining the distance of overlap between their top and bottom edges, ensuring a non-negative value is returned.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testVerticalOverlap() {
    Rectangle rectangle1 = new Rectangle(5f, 2f, 10f, 8f);
    Rectangle rectangle2 = new Rectangle(7f, 0f, 8f, 6f);

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.AssertionError " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
