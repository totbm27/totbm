# Method Intention
The overall intention of the getField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName) method is to recursively search for and return a Field object with the specified fieldName within the given class or its superclasses, handling NoSuchFieldException by traversing up the class hierarchy until the field is found or until the Object class is reached.

# Method Intention
The getField method is intended to retrieve a specific Field object by name from a given class, recursively searching through the class hierarchy if necessary, and returning null if the field is not found.
