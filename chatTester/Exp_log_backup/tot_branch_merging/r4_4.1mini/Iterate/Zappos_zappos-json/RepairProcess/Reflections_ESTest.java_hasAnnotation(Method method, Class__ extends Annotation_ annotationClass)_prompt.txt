# Method Intention
The hasAnnotation method is designed to determine whether a given Java Method object is annotated with a specific annotation type, returning true if the annotation is present and false if the method is null or the annotation is absent.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
