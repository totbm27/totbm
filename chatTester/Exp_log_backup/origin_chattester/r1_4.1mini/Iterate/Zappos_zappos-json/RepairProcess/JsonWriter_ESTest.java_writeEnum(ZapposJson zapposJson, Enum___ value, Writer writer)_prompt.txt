# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public static void writeEnum(ZapposJson zapposJson, Enum<?> value, Writer writer) throws IOException {
    writeString(zapposJson, value.name(), writer);
}

# Method Intention
The writeEnum method is intended to serialize an Enum value by converting its name to a string and writing that string representation to a given Writer using the provided ZapposJson instance's string-writing functionality.

# Test Method
@Test
public void testWriteEnum() throws IOException {
    ZapposJson zapposJson = new ZapposJson();
    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();
      [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.IllegalArgumentException java.lang.Enum is not an enum type " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
