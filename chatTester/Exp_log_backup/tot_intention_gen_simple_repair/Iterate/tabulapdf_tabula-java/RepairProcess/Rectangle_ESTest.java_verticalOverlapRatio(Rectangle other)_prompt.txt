# Method Intention
The verticalOverlapRatio(Rectangle other) method in the Rectangle class calculates the ratio of vertical overlap between two rectangles by comparing their top and bottom coordinates and determining the extent to which they overlap vertically.

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " java.lang.Error Unresolved compilation problem: 
 Type mismatch: cannot convert from double to float

Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
