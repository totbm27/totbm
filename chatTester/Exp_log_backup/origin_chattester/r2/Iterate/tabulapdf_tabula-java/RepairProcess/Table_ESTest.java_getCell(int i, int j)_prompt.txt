# Method Intention
The getExtractionMethod() method is intended to provide access to the extraction method used in the Table class, allowing users to retrieve and potentially utilize information about the specific method employed for data extraction.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
